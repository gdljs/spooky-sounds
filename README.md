Entity Component System for playing spooky sounds.


## Running

## Required

* A MIDI Controller

## Credits for sounds

This project depends on a lot of external samples that I didn't make,
here's the who's who of spooky audio design:

* `samples/bg/rain-night.mp3` [Night Time Storm][night-time-storm] By Natboy
* `samples/trigger/zombie.mp3` [Mummy Zombie][mummy-zombie] By Mike
  Koenig
* [NOTE: Add names as samples are committed]
